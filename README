Presentation
============

This package provides an C library to perform efficient 2D drawings. The
drawing is done by OpenGL which allow us fast and nice rendering of basic
shapes, text and images (and more in future). It has been implemented as a
thin layer that hides the complexity of the OpenGL library.


Supported platforms
===================

Any platforms supported by SDL, freetype 2, fontconfig and freeimage should
be able to compile, and run this library. However it has been tested only
on GNU/Linux and Win32 (using MinGW)


Compilation
===========

This library is organized as a GNU package and can be compiled and
installed in the same way (see INSTALL file for further information).
